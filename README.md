# Thomas Lim - itsthomaslim/behindhiscam
Hey there! I am Thomas Lim, also known by my real name, Ariston Lorenzo.

I am the lead of the Inferno kernel which is a custom kernel for Echo, previously known as Hydra.
I cofounded Null with best-friend, [Levi Cowan](https://github.com/FiReLScar).

I am currently 13 years of age and I don't currently work on CS as a hobby anymore but I will in the near future.
